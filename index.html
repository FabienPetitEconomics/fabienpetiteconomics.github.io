									<h3>Individuals’ values over the lifecycle: does consistency matter?</h3>
									<i>Job Market Paper</i> | Draft available upon request
								</div>
								<div class="content">
									<img class="textwrap" src="images/diagram-concept.gif">
									<p><b>Abstract:</b> The role of values for individuals' choices is well established, and there is a growing interest in how they 
									are determined and change over the lifecycle. Yet, little attention has been paid to the fact that individuals hold a variety of 
									values and that there may be costs when these are not consistent with each other. This paper examines the dynamics of values over 
									the lifecycle and the importance of consistency. Because individuals tend to hold consistent values, life events affect values both directly 
									and indirectly through spillover effects that create interdependence when seeking consistency in values. I build a theoretical 
									framework that jointly analyzes the dynamics of values and life events, taking into account that the latter are endogenous. 
									I then use UK cohort data with measures of attitudes at several ages to estimate values’ inter-dependency. Relying on individuals’ 
									histories, I quantify the impact of several life events on a set of values. The empirical results suggest that values are linked to 
									each other in a non-reciprocal way, that they change over the lifecycle due to life events, and that spillover effects exist and 
									are important. </p>

								<h3>Inter-generational conflict and the declining labor share</h3>

									<img class="textwrap" src="images/quant-bench-ls-color.png">
									<p><b>Abstract:</b> The age structure of the population has received little attention as a determinant of the labor share. 
									This paper argues that demographic dynamics in high-income countries affect the labor share in two different ways: directly 
									through the labor supply and capital accumulation, but also indirectly through public policy. I use an OLG model in which a
									generational conflict arises because young and old individuals have different income sources and opposite objectives in terms 
									of public policy. The youth face unemployment risk and use their political weight to raise the unemployment benefit, while the 
									old favor health expenditures. This tension over the public budget allocation has consequences for wage bargaining and thus 
									for the labor share. Numerical simulations for France and the United States indicate that the model can replicate the data and 
									that boomers’ cohorts have driven the observed decline of the labor share.</p>

								<h3>Inter-generational mobility and job polarization</h3>

									<p><b>Abstract:</b> Job polarization has been a major source of rising income inequality in high-income economies in recent decades. 
									This paper argues that it has also resulted in reduced social mobility. We use data for two cohorts in the UK that entered the labour market 
									at two points in time that differed considerably in terms of the structure of employment, with the younger cohort facing a more polarized environment. 
									In this context, we examine the determinants of the probability of being in high-, middling- and lowpaying occupations at age 42 and their relationship 
									with parental income. The data indicates that the effect of the latter on those probabilities is stronger for the younger than for the older cohort. 
									Moreover, the reduction in the availability of middling jobs for young individuals has been a major factor in this change. 
									On the one hand, those who start their careers in middling jobs have a high probability to move to high-paying occupations, but with fewer entry 
									jobs of this type, this source of upward mobility dried out. On the other, those who started in low-paying jobs experienced mobility mainly 
									by moving into middling occupations. For the younger cohort this is less likely than for the older one, increasing the probability of them remaining 
									in low-paying employment. The reduction in the availability of middling jobs has then implied that individuals from less well-off backgrounds are more 
									likely to both start their careers in low-paying jobs and to stay there in the younger than in the older cohort.</p>
